Hi there!

Guess who has finally got around to trying a custom README! I'll hopefully be expanding this soon, but for now have some key links:

My blog: https://datasciencecastnet.home.blog/

My CV website: https://johnowhitaker.github.io/cv/ ([short PDF version](https://github.com/johnowhitaker/johnowhitaker/blob/master/Jonathan_Whitaker_CV_April_2022.pdf) which is more up-to-date)

Reach me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/johnowhitaker
